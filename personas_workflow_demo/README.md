# Personas demo

This is a demo of the proposed personas feature. It does not include workflow and it is not meant to be polished production code.

If you wish to change the persona options (currently car/truck/bicycle), mnote that there is currently some duplication of configuration between several files. This will of course not be the case in the production version.

This is a tech demo intended for proving out the use case and making sure we're building what you want us to build; however we will no doubt leverage this code to speed up completion of the production version that supports workflow, has sensible configuration options, etc.
